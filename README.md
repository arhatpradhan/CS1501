# CS1501
A collection of projects and labs done in the class Data Structures and Algorithms 2

# Assignment 1 
Purpose: To implement a backtracking algorithm that finds one legal filling of the squares of a given crossword puzzle

# Assignment 2 
Purpose: To implement a simple automatic word-completion system.

Task 1: Implement algorithms for DLB insertion and traversal.
Task 2: Implement an algorithm for retrieving one word prediction.

# Assignment 3 
Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to fully understand the LZW compression algorithm, its performance and its implementation.

Goal 1: Allow the codebook size to increase beyond the 4096 entries in the textbook's implementation using adaptive codeword width

Goal 2: Allow LZW to learn new patterns after the codebook size is reached by giving the user the option to reset the codebook.

# Assignment 4
The purpose of this assignment was to practice implementing some graph algorithms and to see how they can be used in a somewhat practical way, in this assignment we implemented graph algorithms on a fictional airline

# Assignment 5 
The purpose of this assignment is to practice dynamic programming in AI applications.
